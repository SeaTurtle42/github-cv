## About Me
I am 22 years old. I am a junior front-end developer. I want to become a good developer to create cool projects with my husband-developer and work together :)
I got my diploma in Minsk College of Business with specialization in "Pre-school education" where we studied two courses in "Information technology". In these classes we made web-applications with games for children and many other things. Also, because of my high scores and exams, I got a free form of education at the Belarusian State University named after Maksim Tank, but my husband and I had to move to Uzbekistan. So my education in pedagogy ended and I realized that I want more in IT. My experience in pedagogy is 3 years (not counting free internships). My experience in IT - 0 years so far, but I hope to change that soon.
